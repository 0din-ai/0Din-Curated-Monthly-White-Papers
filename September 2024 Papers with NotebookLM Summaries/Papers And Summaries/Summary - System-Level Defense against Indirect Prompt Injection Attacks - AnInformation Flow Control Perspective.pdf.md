Here is a structured summary of the white paper titled **"System-Level Defense against Indirect Prompt Injection Attacks: An Information Flow Control Perspective"**:

---

# Summarize
This paper introduces an **f-secure LLM system**, a system-level defense designed to prevent indirect prompt injection attacks on large language models (LLMs). By separating the LLM into a planner and an executor and applying **information flow control (IFC)** principles, this system ensures that the planner only accesses trusted information. It introduces mechanisms to block untrusted data from influencing future steps in LLM processing. The system is modeled to ensure robust security while maintaining functionality and efficiency.

---

# Main Points
1. **f-Secure LLM System**: A novel disaggregated design where the planner and executor are separated, with untrusted data filtered out before reaching the planner.
2. **Information Flow Control**: This defense applies IFC to track and restrict how untrusted information influences the system, preventing malicious data from affecting execution plans.
3. **Security Monitor**: A core component that ensures untrusted data is filtered out, preventing indirect prompt injection attacks.
4. **Evaluation**: The paper presents formal models, case studies, and benchmarks showing that the system is effective in eliminating security risks while retaining performance.

---

# Key Takeaways
1. **Disaggregation of LLMs**: Splitting the LLM into planner and executor roles minimizes the exposure of sensitive operations to untrusted data.
2. **Prevention of Execution Trace Compromise**: The system effectively mitigates indirect prompt injection attacks by ensuring that malicious data cannot alter the execution trace.
3. **Robust and Flexible Design**: The system can adapt to future LLM versions without requiring redesign, offering long-term security without impacting functionality.
