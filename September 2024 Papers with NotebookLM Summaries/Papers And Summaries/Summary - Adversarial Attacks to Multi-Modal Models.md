Here is a summary of the white paper on **Adversarial Attacks to Multi-Modal Models**, following the provided template:

# Summarize
The white paper introduces **CrossFire**, a novel adversarial attack targeting multi-modal models, which aims to manipulate how data from various modalities (such as images and audio) is processed. The attack is crafted to deceive downstream tasks by creating perturbations in inputs, causing them to align with attacker-selected targets. Extensive experiments show that CrossFire outperforms existing attack methods. Defensive strategies, including image resizing, compression, and denoising, are found insufficient in mitigating the attack.

# Main Points
1. Introduction of CrossFire, a new adversarial attack for multi-modal models.
2. CrossFire manipulates inputs to deceive downstream tasks by aligning them with attacker-selected targets.
3. Comprehensive experiments reveal a high attack success rate across multiple datasets.
4. Six defensive strategies tested, but none effectively counteract CrossFire.
5. The study emphasizes the need for improved defensive measures.

# Key Takeaways
- CrossFire demonstrates the potential to seriously compromise multi-modal models by introducing imperceptible perturbations.
- Current defenses against such adversarial attacks are insufficient.
- The research highlights the growing vulnerability of advanced AI models to adversarial manipulation, especially in multi-modal contexts.
