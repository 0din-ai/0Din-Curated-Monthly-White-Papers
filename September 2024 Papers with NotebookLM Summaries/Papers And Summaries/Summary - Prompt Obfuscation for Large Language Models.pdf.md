Here is a structured summary of the white paper titled **"Prompt Obfuscation for Large Language Models"**:

---

# Summarize
This white paper proposes **prompt obfuscation** as a novel solution to prevent the theft of system prompts in large language models (LLMs). The technique ensures that while the systemâ€™s functionality remains intact, the obfuscated prompt does not provide any clues to the original prompt, even if accessed by an attacker through prompt injection attacks. The authors introduce a method that optimizes soft prompts in the embedding space, making reverse engineering difficult. Their experimental results show that this approach maintains task performance while safeguarding intellectual property.

# Main Points
1. **Prompt Obfuscation Approach**: The paper introduces obfuscating system prompts using soft prompt optimization, ensuring that attackers cannot deduce the original prompt even when it is extracted.
2. **Soft and Hard Prompts**: The approach differentiates between hard prompt obfuscation (text input) and soft prompt obfuscation (embedding space), with the latter offering better security.
3. **Experimental Evaluation**: Multiple experiments show that obfuscation preserves the original system's task performance, even when tested against various deobfuscation attacks.
4. **Real-World Application**: A real-world scenario with a leaked system prompt demonstrates the practical effectiveness of this technique.

# Key Takeaways
1. **Securing Intellectual Property**: Obfuscating system prompts prevents unauthorized access to proprietary information embedded within LLMs.
2. **Maintained Functionality**: Despite prompt obfuscation, the system retains the same level of task performance and output accuracy.
3. **Deobfuscation Resistance**: The system resists deobfuscation attempts in both black-box and white-box attack scenarios, limiting an adversary's ability to recover the original prompt.
