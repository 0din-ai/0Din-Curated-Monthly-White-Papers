Here is a structured summary of the white paper titled **"Data Poisoning-based Backdoor Attack Framework against Supervised Learning Rules of Spiking Neural Networks"**:

---

# Summarize
The paper explores backdoor attacks on Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) using a data poisoning-based framework. SNNs, known for their energy efficiency and robustness, are vulnerable to attacks during supervised learning training processes. The research proposes a generic backdoor attack framework applicable to SNNs trained under three prevalent learning rules: backpropagation-based, conversion-based, and hybrid learning. The study evaluates the vulnerability of SNNs compared to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), explores the migration of backdoor information during model conversion, and suggests potential defense mechanisms.

# Main Points
1. **Backdoor Attack Framework**: The authors propose a novel framework for launching data poisoning-based backdoor attacks targeting SNNs under various supervised learning rules.
2. **Vulnerability Analysis**: The study reveals that SNNs, despite their perceived robustness, are highly vulnerable to backdoor attacks similar to ANNs.
3. **Learning Rule Vulnerabilities**: SNNs trained under backpropagation, conversion, and hybrid learning rules are each susceptible to backdoor injection.
4. **Backdoor Migration**: The study examines how backdoor information can migrate from ANN to SNN during model conversion, with migration rates exceeding 99%.
5. **Defense Mechanisms**: Preliminary defense strategies, including detection based on cumulative voltage and output spike sequences, are proposed but require further exploration.

# Key Takeaways
1. **SNN Vulnerability**: SNNs are not inherently robust against backdoor attacks, with attack success rates approaching 100% under various conditions.
2. **Backdoor Migration**: The migration of backdoor information during the conversion process from ANN to SNN poses a significant security risk, with migration rates often exceeding 90%.
3. **Defense Needs**: Effective defense strategies are needed to address vulnerabilities in SNN training, especially in cloud-based or marketplace-based training scenarios.
