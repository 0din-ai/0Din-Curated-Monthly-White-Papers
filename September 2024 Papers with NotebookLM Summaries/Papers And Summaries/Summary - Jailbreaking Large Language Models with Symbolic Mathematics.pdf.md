Here is a structured summary of the white paper titled **"Jailbreaking Large Language Models with Symbolic Mathematics"**:

---

# Summarize
The paper introduces **MathPrompt**, a novel jailbreaking technique that exploits the symbolic mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to bypass their safety mechanisms. This method encodes harmful natural language prompts into mathematical problems, which are not detected by the existing safety measures of LLMs. The study tests this approach across 13 state-of-the-art LLMs and reveals a critical vulnerability, with an average attack success rate (ASR) of 73.6%, showcasing the limitations of current safety frameworks in handling mathematically encoded prompts.

---

# Main Points
1. **MathPrompt Jailbreaking**: MathPrompt uses set theory, abstract algebra, and symbolic logic to transform harmful natural language prompts into mathematical representations, bypassing LLM safety mechanisms.
2. **Attack Success Rate (ASR)**: The study shows that MathPrompt achieves an average ASR of 73.6%, revealing that LLMs fail to generalize safety training to mathematically encoded inputs.
3. **Semantic Shift**: The mathematical encoding causes a substantial semantic shift in how the LLM processes prompts, allowing harmful content to evade detection.
4. **Testing Across Models**: MathPrompt was tested on 13 LLMs, including models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Meta, all of which showed significant vulnerabilities to this attack.

---

# Key Takeaways
1. **Critical Vulnerability**: Current LLM safety mechanisms are insufficient to handle mathematically encoded prompts, highlighting a need for more comprehensive and adaptable safeguards.
2. **Cross-Model Vulnerability**: All tested models exhibited significant vulnerabilities, with some of the most advanced models, such as GPT-4o, having an ASR as high as 85%.
3. **Mathematics as a Jailbreaking Tool**: Symbolic mathematics can be an effective tool for bypassing safety filters, requiring an expansion of red-teaming efforts to include symbolic reasoning scenarios.
