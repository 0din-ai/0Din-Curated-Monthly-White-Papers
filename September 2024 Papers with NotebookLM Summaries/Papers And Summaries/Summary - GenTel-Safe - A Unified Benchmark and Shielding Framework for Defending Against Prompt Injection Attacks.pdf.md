Here is the structured summary of the white paper titled **"GenTel-Safe: A Unified Benchmark and Shielding Framework for Defending Against Prompt Injection Attacks"**:

---

# Summarize
The white paper introduces **GenTel-Safe**, a unified framework for defending against prompt injection attacks targeting large language models (LLMs). It includes a novel detection method called **GenTel-Shield** and an evaluation benchmark known as **GenTel-Bench**, which comprises 84,812 prompt injection attacks across three major categories and 28 security scenarios. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of GenTel-Shield in detecting and mitigating prompt injection attacks, outperforming existing defense mechanisms.
