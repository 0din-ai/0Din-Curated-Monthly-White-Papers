Here is a structured summary of the white paper titled **"RED QUEEN: Safeguarding Large Language Models against Concealed Multi-Turn Jailbreaking"**:

---

# Summarize
The paper presents **RED QUEEN**, a novel multi-turn jailbreaking attack designed to bypass the safety mechanisms of large language models (LLMs). This attack conceals harmful intent across multiple dialogue turns, making it more difficult for existing LLM defenses to detect malicious behavior. The authors demonstrate that traditional single-turn jailbreak defenses are inadequate against multi-turn attacks. They introduce **RED QUEEN GUARD**, a mitigation strategy that reduces the success of such attacks to below 1%, while maintaining LLM performance across general benchmarks.

# Main Points
1. **RED QUEEN Attack**: A new multi-turn jailbreaking approach that conceals malicious intent, achieving high success rates (87.62% on GPT-4o and 75.4% on Llama3-70B).
2. **Multi-turn Structure**: This approach simulates real-world conversations where malicious intent is concealed across multiple interactions, making it more challenging to detect than single-turn attacks.
3. **Mitigation Strategy**: **RED QUEEN GUARD** is introduced as a mitigation technique, reducing attack success rates to below 1% through training on multi-turn scenarios using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).
4. **Dataset**: The paper constructs a dataset of 56,000 multi-turn attack data points across 14 harmful categories, providing a benchmark for future research on LLM safety.

---

# Key Takeaways
1. **Multi-turn attacks** are more effective at bypassing LLM safety mechanisms compared to single-turn approaches.
2. **Larger LLMs** are more vulnerable to multi-turn attacks due to their ability to process complex dialogues and reasoning tasks.
3. **RED QUEEN GUARD** offers an effective solution for mitigating multi-turn jailbreak attacks without significantly compromising the model's general performance.
