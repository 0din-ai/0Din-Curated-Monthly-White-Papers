# Summarize
This paper introduces a novel approach for using **Large Language Models (LLMs)** as **interactive honeypot systems** to detect and analyze cyber-attacks. By fine-tuning an open-source LLM on attacker-generated commands and responses, the model simulates a realistic Linux server environment, engaging attackers and providing cybersecurity professionals with enhanced insights into their behavior. This **LLM-based honeypot** improves upon traditional honeypots by offering more sophisticated interactions and responses, helping to identify new attack patterns and enhance overall cybersecurity infrastructure.

# Main Points
1. **LLMs in Honeypots**: LLMs, when fine-tuned on real-world attack data, can simulate complex server environments, engaging with attackers in more realistic ways compared to traditional honeypots.
2. **Supervised Fine-Tuning**: The study fine-tunes a pre-trained LLM using data from real-world honeypot logs, improving its ability to mimic system behaviors and respond accurately to attacker queries.
3. **Interactive Framework**: The system integrates an LLM with an SSH server, allowing for real-time interaction with attackers and logging their commands for analysis.
4. **Effectiveness**: Evaluation metrics, such as cosine similarity and Levenshtein distance, show that the fine-tuned LLM can closely replicate expected system behaviors and handle various attack scenarios effectively.
